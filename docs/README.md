# The Consciousness-Field Hypothesis (CFH)

A comprehensive theoretical framework proposing that consciousness modulates quantum correlations via a scalar Ψ-field, with testable predictions for super-quantum phenomena.

## Project Overview

This repository contains the complete theoretical development, experimental protocols, and supporting materials for the Consciousness-Field Hypothesis - a novel approach to understanding the relationship between consciousness and quantum mechanics.

## Key Components

### 📚 **Theoretical Framework**
- **Ψ-Field Lagrangian**: `L = L_QM + ½(∂ψ)² - ½m²ψ² - λψ⁴/4 + κψÔ(x)`
- **Hyper-causal propagation**: Speed C ≈ 10²⁰c
- **CHSH amplification**: `a = 1 + κ_eff⟨ψ⟩`

### 🧪 **Experimental Protocols**
1. **EEG-Gated CHSH**: Testing consciousness-modulated Bell violations
2. **NV-Center Spin Drift**: Probing field effects during altered states
3. **Remote-Viewer Double-Slit**: Long-range consciousness effects

### 🔬 **Mathematical Foundations**
- Rigorous proofs of micro-causality, renormalizability, and vacuum stability
- Dimensional analysis and propagator theory
- Connection to established quantum field theory
