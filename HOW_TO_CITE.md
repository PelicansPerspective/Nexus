  url = {https://github.com/nexus-team/nexus},
  abstract = {We propose the Consciousness-Field Hypothesis (CFH), a novel theoretical framework that describes consciousness as arising from quantum field interactions mediated by a scalar field (the Ψ field). This framework provides mathematical formulations for consciousness-field coupling through neural microtubule quantum coherence and makes specific, testable predictions for experimental validation.}
