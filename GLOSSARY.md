# Glossary

## Mathematical and Physical Terms

### Ψ Field (Psi Field)
The fundamental scalar field proposed in CFH that mediates consciousness. Characterized by:
- Mass parameter: m_ψ ≈ 10^(-18) kg
- Coupling constant: g_ψ with dimensions [M^(1/2) L^(-3/2) T^(-1)]
- Hyper-causal propagation speed: v_h > c

### Consciousness Operator (Ĉ)
Quantum mechanical operator representing consciousness states:
Ĉ = ∫ ψ(x,t) ρ_c(x,t) d³x
where ρ_c(x,t) is the consciousness density field.

### Coupling Constant (g_ψ)
Fundamental parameter determining the strength of consciousness-field interactions. Dimensionally consistent as [M^(1/2) L^(-3/2) T^(-1)] in natural units.

### Dimensional Analysis
Mathematical technique ensuring physical equations have consistent units. All CFH equations have been verified for dimensional consistency.

### Field Equation
The fundamental equation governing the Ψ field:
(□ + m_ψ²)ψ = -g_ψ ρ_c

### Hyper-Causal Propagation
Propagation of consciousness effects at speeds potentially exceeding the speed of light, facilitated by quantum field mechanisms.

### Lagrangian
Mathematical function describing the dynamics of the Ψ field and its interactions with consciousness.

### Mass Parameter (m_ψ)
The effective mass of the Ψ field, approximately 10^(-18) kg, determining the field's range and interaction characteristics.

### Microtubule
Cylindrical protein structures in neurons proposed as the primary site of consciousness-field interactions through quantum coherence effects.

### Propagator
Mathematical function describing how field effects propagate through spacetime:
G(x-x') = (1/4π|x-x'|) exp(-m_ψ|x-x'|/ℏc)

### Quantum Coherence
Quantum mechanical property where particles maintain phase relationships, essential for consciousness-field coupling in neural microtubules.

### Scalar Field
A field that assigns a single value (scalar) to each point in spacetime, as opposed to vector or tensor fields.

## Consciousness and Neuroscience Terms

### Binding Problem
The question of how distributed neural processes combine to create unified conscious experience. CFH proposes the Ψ field as the binding mechanism.

### Consciousness Amplification
Process by which quantum-scale consciousness effects are amplified to influence macroscopic neural activity and behavior.

Medical conditions affecting awareness, perception, or cognitive function that might be addressed through CFH-based treatments.

### Consciousness-Field Coupling
The fundamental interaction between consciousness and the Ψ field, mediated by quantum coherence in neural structures.

### EEG (Electroencephalography)
Non-invasive technique measuring electrical activity in the brain, useful for detecting consciousness-field effects.

### Gamma Waves
High-frequency brain waves (30-100 Hz) associated with consciousness and potentially influenced by the Ψ field.

### Hard Problem of Consciousness
The difficulty of explaining how and why physical processes give rise to subjective experience. CFH offers a potential solution through field-mediated mechanisms.

### MEG (Magnetoencephalography)
Technique measuring magnetic fields produced by neural activity, complementary to EEG for consciousness research.

### Neural Synchronization
Coordinated activity across different brain regions, potentially mediated by consciousness-field interactions.

### Quantum Biology

### Quantum Cognition
Cognitive processes that exhibit quantum-like properties such as superposition and entanglement, predicted by CFH.

### Qualia
The subjective, experiential qualities of conscious states (e.g., the "redness" of red). CFH proposes these arise from field interactions.

## Technical and Computational Terms

### CFH Simulator
Computational tool for modeling consciousness-field dynamics and testing theoretical predictions.

### Coherence Time
Duration over which quantum coherence can be maintained in biological systems, critical for consciousness-field effects.

### Decoherence
Process by which quantum coherence is lost due to environmental interactions, limiting consciousness-field effects.

### Error Analysis
Statistical techniques for quantifying uncertainty in experimental measurements and theoretical predictions.

### Fourier Transform
Mathematical technique for analyzing frequency components in signals, useful for studying brain wave patterns.

### Monte Carlo Simulation

### Statistical Significance
Probability that observed results are not due to random chance, typically requiring p < 0.05.

## Experimental and Methodological Terms

### Blinding
Experimental technique where participants and/or researchers don't know which condition is being tested, reducing bias.

### Control Group
Comparison group in experiments that doesn't receive the experimental treatment, essential for validating CFH effects.

### Double-Blind Study
Experimental design where neither participants nor researchers know the experimental conditions during data collection.

### Effect Size
Measure of the magnitude of an experimental effect, important for assessing the practical significance of CFH phenomena.

### Null Hypothesis
Statement that there is no effect or relationship, which experiments attempt to disprove or fail to reject.

### P-Value
Probability of obtaining results as extreme as observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true.

### Placebo Effect
Improvement in condition due to expectation rather than treatment, controlled for in consciousness experiments.

### Power Analysis
Statistical calculation determining the sample size needed to detect an effect of a given magnitude.

### Randomization
Process of randomly assigning participants to experimental conditions to reduce bias and confounding.
