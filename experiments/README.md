# Experimental Protocols for CFH Validation

This directory contains detailed experimental protocols designed to test the predictions of the Consciousness-Field Hypothesis.

## Overview

The CFH makes three primary testable predictions that can be experimentally validated:

1. **CHSH Parameter Enhancement**: S > 2.828 during high neural coherence
2. **Remote Consciousness Effects**: Non-local modulation of quantum systems
3. **Field Detection**: Direct measurement of Ψ-field using sensitive magnetometry

## Experimental Program

### 🎯 Priority 1: EEG-Gated CHSH Experiment

**Objective**: Test for consciousness-modulated violations of Tsirelson's bound

**Setup Requirements**:
- Entangled photon source (SPDC, 810nm pump)
- Polarization analyzers with Pockels cell switching
- Single photon detectors (dark count < 100 Hz)
- 64-channel EEG system (2 kHz sampling)
- Quantum random number generator
- Faraday cage and vibration isolation

**Protocol**:
1. Generate entangled photon pairs
2. Monitor subject's gamma-band PLV (35-45 Hz)
3. Gate CHSH measurements on high/low coherence states
4. Target 40,000 trials per condition
5. Statistical analysis for S > 2.828

**Success Criteria**: p < 10⁻⁵ significance, replication in 4+ labs

### 🎯 Priority 2: Remote-Viewer Double-Slit

**Objective**: Test long-range consciousness effects on quantum interference

**Setup Requirements**:
- Mach-Zehnder interferometer
- Remote viewing protocol (1500+ km separation)
- Synchronized timing system (±0.5 ms)
- Trained remote viewers (>75% accuracy baseline)
- Environmental controls (temperature ±0.05°C)

**Protocol**:
1. Remote viewers attempt to "sharpen" interference fringes
2. Measure visibility shift ΔV = V_open - V_baseline
3. Correlate with viewer EEG coherence
4. Target effect size ΔV ≈ 0.02

**Success Criteria**: Statistically significant visibility enhancement

### 🎯 Priority 3: NV-Center Magnetometry

**Objective**: Direct detection of Ψ-field during altered consciousness states

**Setup Requirements**:
- NV-center diamond magnetometer
- Meditation chamber with EMF shielding
- DMT administration protocols (where legal)
- Baseline noise floor < 1 nT/√Hz
- Continuous monitoring system

**Protocol**:
1. Establish baseline magnetic field measurements
2. Monitor during meditation/altered states
3. Look for coherent field drifts beyond noise
4. Correlate with subjective reports and EEG

**Success Criteria**: Reproducible field anomalies during consciousness alterations
