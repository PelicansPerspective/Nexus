### Data Analysis

#### EEG Processing
```python
# Real-time PLV calculation
def calculate_plv(eeg_data, freq_range=(35, 45), fs=2000):
    """Calculate phase-locking value for gamma band"""
    # Bandpass filter
    filtered = bandpass_filter(eeg_data, freq_range, fs)
    
    # Hilbert transform for instantaneous phase
    analytic_signal = hilbert(filtered)
    phase = np.angle(analytic_signal)
    
    # PLV across electrode pairs
    plv = np.abs(np.mean(np.exp(1j * phase_diff)))
    return plv
```

#### CHSH Calculation
```python
def compute_chsh_parameter(coincidences, analyzer_angles):
    """Compute CHSH parameter from coincidence data"""
    # Extract correlations for each analyzer combination
    C_00 = correlation(coincidences, angles=(0, 22.5))
    C_01 = correlation(coincidences, angles=(0, 67.5))
    C_10 = correlation(coincidences, angles=(45, 22.5))
    C_11 = correlation(coincidences, angles=(45, 67.5))
    
    # CHSH parameter
    S = abs(C_00 + C_11) + abs(C_01 - C_10)
    return S
```

#### Statistical Analysis
```python
# Primary analysis: compare S values between high/low PLV states
high_plv_S = chsh_values[plv_high_mask]
low_plv_S = chsh_values[plv_low_mask]

# Wilcoxon signed-rank test
statistic, p_value = wilcoxon(high_plv_S, low_plv_S, alternative='greater')

# Effect size calculation
effect_size = (np.mean(high_plv_S) - np.mean(low_plv_S)) / np.std(low_plv_S)

# Tsirelson bound violations
violations = np.sum(high_plv_S > 2.828)
violation_rate = violations / len(high_plv_S)
```

### Success Criteria

#### Primary Endpoint
- **Statistical Significance**: p < 0.001 for S_high > S_low comparison
- **Effect Size**: Cohen's d > 0.3 for meaningful difference

    # Spatial Fourier analysis to extract fundamental fringe component
    fft_pattern = np.fft.fft(fringe_pattern)
    fundamental_amplitude = np.abs(fft_pattern[1])
    dc_component = np.abs(fft_pattern[0])
    
    # Visibility calculation
    visibility = fundamental_amplitude / dc_component
    return visibility
```

### Data Analysis

#### Primary Analysis
```python
# Compare visibility between focus and rest trials
focus_visibility = visibility_data[focus_mask]
rest_visibility = visibility_data[rest_mask]

# Statistical test
t_stat, p_value = ttest_ind(focus_visibility, rest_visibility)

# Effect size
delta_V = np.mean(focus_visibility) - np.mean(rest_visibility)
effect_size = delta_V / np.std(rest_visibility)
```

#### Correlation Analysis
```python
# Time-series correlation with viewer state
correlation, lag = cross_correlation(visibility_time_series, 
                                   viewer_state_time_series)

# EEG correlation (if available)
eeg_correlation = pearsonr(visibility_data, viewer_plv_data)
```

### Success Criteria
- **Primary**: ΔV > 0.01 with p < 0.001
- **Secondary**: Correlation with viewer EEG coherence
- **Validation**: Replication across multiple viewer-lab pairs
